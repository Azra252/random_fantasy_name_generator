# random_fantasy_name_generator
Definition
A Random Fantasy Name Generator is a program that automatically creates fictional names suitable for characters, places, items, or other fantasy-world elements. It uses randomization, linguistic patterns, and/or predefined templates to produce names that sound believable and fit within different fantasy genres (like medieval, elvish, sci-fi, etc.).

🛠️ Key Components


Component	Description
Word Pools	Lists of prefixes, suffixes, syllables, and templates based on different themes (Elvish, Dwarven, etc.).
Randomization Functions	Functions that randomly pick parts from the word pools and combine them.
Theme System	Different settings for name generation styles (e.g., "dark", "sci-fi", "ancient").
Output Formatter	Code that formats the generated names nicely (capitalize, remove extra dashes, etc.).
(Optional) Markov Chains	Advanced feature: analyze real names to generate new ones that "sound right."
(Optional) CLI / Web Interface	For users to pick a theme and get names easily.
🧩** Basic Functions (Starter Plan)**

Function	Purpose
generate_name(theme: str) -> str	Main function that picks a theme and generates a name.
get_random_syllable(pool: List[str]) -> str	Picks a random syllable from a list.
combine_parts(parts: List[str]) -> str	Combines multiple syllables/parts into one word.
format_name(name: str) -> str	Cleans and capitalizes the final name properly.
load_theme_data(theme: str) -> dict	Loads word lists and templates for the selected theme.
**Advanced Features (Future Ideas)**
Markov Name Generator: instead of fixed prefixes/suffixes, learn patterns from existing names.

Name Sets: generate full names (first + last), e.g., "Thandor Mithrellan".

Fantasy Place Names: "The Shrouded Vale", "Mistwood Hollow".

User Input Customization: allow users to pick number of syllables, starting letter, etc.

JSON/YAML Wordpacks: store word pools in external files for easier expansion.
